#  DeepFake Detection Lite  
### Real vs AI-Generated Face Classification using Transfer Learning (EfficientNet, ResNet & MobileNet)

---

##  Project Overview
This project detects whether a face image is **real** or **AI-generated**.  
It was developed as part of an AI coursework assignment, where the requirement was:

 Use a Kaggle dataset  
 Add **custom self-generated data**  
 Train a machine learning model  
 Evaluate whether the model can detect the custom data  
 Compare accuracy across multiple models  

This repository fulfills all those requirements with a clean, reproducible pipeline.

## Goals of the Project
- Classify human face images as **Real** or **Fake**
- Extend dataset using **custom AI-generated fake faces**
- Train multiple deep learning models:
  - EfficientNetB0  
  - ResNet50  
  - MobileNetV2  
- Compare accuracy, loss, and AUC scores
- Evaluate model generalization using **unseen custom fake images**
